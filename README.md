# Rotation #14 - Sirius

Title: NXOS

Description: Sirius created a script, which is to be used by junior engineers, to check N6k and N9k versions, upgrade the version if necessary, and then copy a locally saved config file to the running config of the device. This script can be run from USB natively on the Nexus devices.
